# Rain-Sensor
Rammed Earth Rain Sensors
Materials: 
rammed earth :  
HILetgo LM393 rain sensor, this measures rain fall location, time and intensity: 
CQRobot Oceans: TDS Meter, this measures total dissolved solids in the water such as salts, minerals and metals: 
BME280, which measure barometric pressure in pascals, temperature and humidity: 
An extremely bright as the sun LED: 
An OLED screen, displaying readings in real-time on the sculpture :
Photon 2 micro controller

Things I will add
Conductive paint and epoxy:
A capacitive touch controller: 
PH Sensor: 
Custom PCB boards: 

Objective: Collect rainfall data i.e. intensity, frequency, total dissolved solids, Ph levels and rainfall sound at different locations across the city to help in the civil engineering of water mitigation. To transfer such data via cloud as open-sourced information. ![image](https://github.com/tressays/Rain-Sensor/assets/127724451/ce640f42-e57d-49c6-8ac7-bc49b81f5070)
